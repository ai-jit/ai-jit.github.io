# 人生的选择

-----
      You can't step into the same river twice. And you can't have two kinds of life.
Different choices lead to the different kind of life. And the only way to cure the pain of anxiety is the action. No matter how late the action is. What really matters is that you are on the way to your desitination.
    We have to commit that the choice is hard, especially in the key point of your life. Choose the major, choose the work and so on. Life have too many uncertain factors. And what you can do is just do the right thing. Take the right road. Follow your heart and never step back.
    But thinking about the past will help you to moving closer to your destination.
    OK. That's for today's thoughts.
